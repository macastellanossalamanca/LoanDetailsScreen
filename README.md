## Fintech Loan Detail iOS App

- This App displays a list the information of a loan and its detailed view, obtained from a provided Json file.
- The architechture used in this project is MVVM and Delegate Pattern.
- This project also abstracts Data Manage, therefore we can find a DataManager which fullfills Repository Pattern requirements, and asures scalability for new data manage features in the future.
- Its interface is implemented using SwiftUI, which ensures a reactive response.

# How it works

- Just below you can find a video of the project running.
